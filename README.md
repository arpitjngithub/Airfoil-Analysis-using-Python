# Airfoils Analysis and OpenVSP Glider Design

**Course:** Low Speed Aerodynamics
**Instructor:** Prof. Dhwanil Shukla  
**Department:** Aerospace Engineering  
**Duration:** January 2024 - May 2024

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and analysis of a glider model using OpenVSP and Python, as part of the AE 244 course project. The primary goal was to design a glider capable of carrying one passenger, ensuring it could glide 30 km from a release altitude of 1 km.

### Key Features

- **Glider Design in OpenVSP:**  
  Created a glider model tailored for 1 passenger with a design focus on achieving a 30 km glide distance from a 1 km altitude release.

- **2-D Airfoil Analysis using Python:**  
  Developed Python code to generate streamline plots based on thin-airfoil theory and to estimate parasitic drag. Achieved a 96% consistency in circulation calculation around the airfoil using two distinct methods.

- **Airfoil Optimization and Validation:**  
  Optimized airfoil selection through a combination of 2-D Ansys CFD simulations and Python-based data analysis, ensuring high performance and accuracy.

## Tools & Technologies

- **OpenVSP**
- **Python**
- **Ansys CFD**

## Results

- Successfully designed a glider model that meets the specified criteria.
- Developed reliable Python scripts for airfoil analysis, contributing to a better understanding of low-speed aerodynamics.
